# DevHub
this one is for the developers looking to help boost their productivity.

Excited to announce my most recent project "DevHub" - A Modern Project Generator for Developers!

üõ†Ô∏è As a developer, I wanted to streamline the project creation process, so I built DevHub: an elegant desktop application that helps developers quickly scaffold new projects with templates.
‚ú® Key Features:
Modern, intuitive dark-themed UI
One-click project generation
Multiple framework templates (HTML/CSS, React, Electron) + more to come including RedM / FiveM script templates 
Built-in auto-updates
üîß Built with Electron, Node.js, and modern web technologies.

Simply - you want to build a website using html css js? dont want to write up the initial base code to get started? open DevHub and click create project! boom! code your website away!
